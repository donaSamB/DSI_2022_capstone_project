# DSI_2022_capstone_project
## concept 
a content base skincare recommendation system.
this is my capstone project for the Misk DSI 2022 BootCamp. 
it's a recommendation system that takes in a name of a product and returns products similar to it based on three factors.

how similar the products are in terms of which skin types they are made for. Second, their category (ex: cleansers, moisturizers). and lastly, the ingredient list used in both products. 
afterward, it will return the top 5 similar products to the input product.
##techniques used to build the prediction model:
1-counterVectorizer
2-Cosine Similarity

the data set was collected from the following open-source repo: https://github.com/ArsalanKhan0608/SkinCare-Recommender-System

##files in this repo include:
Data - a file including the data set for this project.
Script - a file where both my EDA and preprocessing + Model ipynb are.
presentation - a file where my final presentation is.
